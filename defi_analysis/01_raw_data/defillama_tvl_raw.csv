In simple terms, users on Yeti Finance can open up a borrowing position on their entire portfolio instead of just a single asset. Cross-margining makes borrowing against volatile assets much safer as multiple assets can serve as collateral for your loan instead of just one, greatly reducing the risk of liquidations due to asset volatility and flash crashes. Unlock deep liquidity, borrow at the lowest collateral ratios, and borrow against your entire portfolio to gain better protection against liquidations.
